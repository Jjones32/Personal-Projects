        <h2>Jake</h2>
        <p> Highly motivated and dedicated to my new field of software development and engineering. I am looking for a company in this field, where I can contribute to the company in a meaningful way. I am a detail driven, consistent, creative mindset that is intrigued by problems but even more ready to solve them to the best of my ability. My interest and drive for this field grows by the day and I can't wait to get started on my new great career!</p>
        <p> I was born in Cincinnati, OH and raised in Hamilton, OH about 20 miles away. Growing up I was very into sports, I played football and baseball for my school teams until college. I attended Colorado Mountain College (Spring Valley) as a business administration major in 2016. </p>
        <p> In my free time in college I loved to go snowboarding, hiking, and white water rafting. I worked as a white water raft guide as well as a lifeguard at the worlds larges natural hotspring pool the Glenwood Hot Springs in Glenwood Springs, CO where My alma mater is located and where I lived.</p>
        <p> After college I stayed in Colorado for a few more years working as a guide and a guard, before moving back to Michigan in 2018. Once back in michigan I worked odd jobs here and there while I was figuring out what I was going to do with my life. I then came across a job that brought me to the Detroit area where I am currently located, that job was StockX. Stockx gave me the opportunity to go to school for coding because of the family of companies connection between Grand Circus and StockX.</p>
        <p> Grand Circus peaked my interest for their impressive resume of students and their accomplishments after graduation. Using the workforce based curriculm that my teacher prepared I absorbed as much as possible not only in skill, but also workplace flow and etiquette, as we focused on pair and team programming as well as working in cloud based environments.</p>
